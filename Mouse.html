        Mice, scientifically known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse" target="_blank">Mus musculus</a>, are small rodents found all over the world. They are known for their adaptability, curiosity, and quick movements. Mice play important roles in ecosystems and are also commonly kept as pets and used in scientific research.<br>
        Mice have excellent hearing and a keen sense of smell, which helps them find food and avoid predators. Their small size allows them to squeeze through tiny spaces and explore their environment.<br>
        In addition to their ecological importance, mice have contributed greatly to scientific discoveries, especially in genetics and medicine.<br>
