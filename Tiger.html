        <P>Tigers, the largest wild cats in the world, belong to the genus Panthera and are known scientifically as Panthera tigris.<br> These majestic apex predators are solitary hunters, relying on stealth and power to catch prey like deer, wild boar, and buffalo. Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern that helps with camouflage in their native Asian habitats, which once stretched from Turkey to eastern Russia. Today, six subspecies remain: Bengal, Siberian, Indochinese, Malayan, South China, and Sumatran, with the Bengal being the most numerous and the Siberian the largest. Tigers are excellent swimmers and unlike most cats, they enjoy water, often cooling off in rivers and lakes.<br> They can leap over 10 meters and their roar can be heard up to 3 kilometers away. Cubs are born blind and stay with their mother for about two years.<br> Tigers mark territory with scent and scratches and are mostly nocturnal. In the wild, they live up to 15 years, and longer in captivity.<br> Sadly, their numbers have declined due to habitat loss and poaching, with body parts used in traditional medicine and skins sold illegally. Conservation efforts like Indiaâ€™s Project Tiger, launched in 1973, aim to protect them.<br> Tigers are symbols of strength and courage in many cultures, appearing in myths, art, and literature, and are national animals of India and Bangladesh. White tigers, a genetic variant of the Bengal tiger, are rare and mostly found in captivity, though inbreeding has led to health issues.<br> Tigers play a vital role in ecosystems by controlling herbivore populations and indicating forest health. Their survival is threatened by human-tiger conflict, livestock predation, and shrinking habitats, but technology like drones, camera traps, and AI is helping conservationists monitor and protect them. Countries like Nepal and Bhutan have made significant progress through community-based efforts. Tigers inspire awe and respect, and saving them means preserving biodiversity and forests. Every tiger counts, and their future depends on global awareness, cooperation, and action.<br></P>
